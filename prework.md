### Introduction

This prework should be completed before class starts. You can do it over a weekend, or you can spread it out over a longer period of time if you prefer. Please don't rush yourself. Its purpose is to arm you with basic knowledge that you can hopefully gain independently of classroom instruction. The last section mentions a few things I'd like you to email me.

### Computer Setup

For the purposes of this prework, all you need is a browser; we generally use [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). For our class, we'll be using [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for development. We'll be installing these things the day before class during the install party, but it's fine if you've already done so.

### Java

Java will be the main language we work with during the class. Please work through parts one and two of [KTByte Interactive Textbook in Java](https://www.ktbyte.com/java-tutorial/book). Then work through the [Codecademy course on Java](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-java).

### Clojure

We'll be learning some Clojure later in the course to familiarize ourselves with the new industry trend towards functional programming. Please read through [Do Things: a Clojure Crash Course](http://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/). After that, watch [my talk about Clojure games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GzzFeS5cMc)!

### HTML & CSS

While not a focus of the course, we will need to do some front-end development when we get into web applications. Work through the [Codecademy course on HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) so you have a basic familiarity with them.

### Git

Working with Git will be a huge part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement almost anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to collaborate with other programmers.

Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account, as it is the most popular Git host and the one we'll be using throughout the class. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name. Then, work through [Try Github](https://try.github.io/), a short course on how to use Git.

### Deliverables

Please email zach@theironyard.com your Github username. Please take the opportunity to also tell me about any difficulties you think you'll encounter during the course.
