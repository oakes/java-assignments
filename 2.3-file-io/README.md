# File I/O

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Description

Write a program that asks the user to enter information about a particular artistic work (it could be an album, movie, game, book, etc). Ask for at least five different attributes, like title, author, and genre. Save the information to a file as a JSON object. When the program runs again, it should read the file and print out the data, then give the user the option to update it.

## Requirements

* Prompt the user to answer at least five different questions about an artistic work.
* Save the information into a JSON object in a file.
* When the program first boots, read the file and display the contents.
* Give the user the ability to update the information and re-save it to the file.
* If the JSON parsing fails, give a friendly error rather than crashing the program.
