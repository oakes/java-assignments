# Methods

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Description

For each of the classes you made yesterday, write constructors, setters, and getters. Test your code in JREPL as you go along.

## Requirements

* In each class, write a constructor that sets all of its fields.
* In each class, write setters and getters for all of its fields.
* In each class, make at least one setter method contain an `if` statement that makes it enforce some kind of constraint.
* Optional: Refactor your `if` statements so the code inside the parenthesis is moved into its own method.
